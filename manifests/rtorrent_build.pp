#
# ==== Class: rtorrent::rtorrent_build
#
# Builds rtorrent from source due to most distros do not compile rtorrent
# with xmlrpc-c. rtorrent is also out of date in some distros.
#
# Process: All required development packages and compilers are installed first.
# The libtorrent repo is cloned from github and compiled. Then the rtorrent repo
# is cloned from github and compiled. See files/rtorrent-build.sh (after this class
# is executed it is in /home/rtorrent/rtorrent-build.sh) for details
#
# ==== Parameters:
#
# There are no parameters for this class
